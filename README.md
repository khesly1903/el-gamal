The El-Gamal cryptosystem provides a secure encryption and decryption cryptosystem based on the fundamental principles of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.  
Main code is el_gamal_ec_pointmsg.py. This code demonstrates how the El-Gamal encryption system is applied on an elliptic curve. When selecting the elliptic curve, only the finite field F_p is used instead of the extended field F_p^n (different methods are used for the p^n case). It operates with large prime numbers used in El-Gamal encryption, but may experience a loss of performance with very large prime numbers.
